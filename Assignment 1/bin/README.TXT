Project Introduction and Overview
This application is a functional math calculator. The calculator is able to compute complete expressions like: 9 + 4 - ( 1 + 2 ) - 1
The design is based on a super class Operator. The superclass is an abstract class that creates child 
objects of 10 different operator types. 
There was 5 tasked to complete. 
1. algorithm completion
2. Test implementation for all possible cases
3. Remove all efficiencies 
4. Reused Evaluator implementation with GUI Calculator

Assumption: 
Some of the actions that I took to complete this project was trying to look at the process in different points of views. 
I was tackled the project step by step, first completing the algorithm part. 
Second, making sure everything is organized and have clean code after all cases have been satisfied. 
Third, I tackled the GUI part and connected all parts.
